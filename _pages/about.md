Thank you for visiting my site, I hope you find it useful :)

My name is Yuval Itzchakov, I am 30 years old and I live in Israel. I've been professionally programming for the last 7 years,
in which I've explored various challanges and technologies. From creating computation intensive applications in C# to working with distributed systems such as Spark, Akka, etc. I've been a growing fan of Functional Programming for the past 3 years, learning alot, and teaching others where possible.

In this site you'll mainly find my personal technical journey, possibly some personal notes as well.

If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to do so via the information on your left (Twitter, LinkedIn, E-Mail).
